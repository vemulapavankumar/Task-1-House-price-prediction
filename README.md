# House_price_prediction

This repository is for my first task as an intern in "BHARAT INTERN".
The task is to create a machine learning model to predict house price using linear regression only.
(Here I created both Linear regression and random forest Model for better understanding of accuracy)
The code is done in Jupyter notebook.
